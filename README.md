# Work-Day-scheduler

## Description 

This project designed a simple current day scheduler that uses moment.js to get current date information and uses local storage to save inputted appointments/tasks for each time block. Additionally, the scheduler is color coded based on the past, present, or future time. 

This project utilized jQuery to dynamically create and manipulate elements based on data attributes. Client-side storage was implemented to store saved entries so that they persist after refreshing the page. 

Event delegation is also implemented to match the clicked save buttons with the data attribute that corresponds with the inputted text. Conditional statements are used to determine color coding, appropriate suffixes (PM/AM), and to check for existing local storage variables.
